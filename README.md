# Title Goes Here
This is my 10.2 final project. 
It's basically rock paper scissors with a built-in magic 8-ball to tell you how your moves are gonna go. 
(it's usually wrong)

## Team members

## Instructions
To play just enter 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors, and then click through the prompts to get your result.

## What I learned
* I practiced making sprites
* I learned to use vscode and github together with makecode. Before, I had only used them each individually.
* comitting regularly is important
* comitting is not the same as releasing a new version
## How to run the game
Go to the primary page of the main branch, and copy the link at the top of the page. Then go to makecode arcade, click import, and paste the link in the box.
